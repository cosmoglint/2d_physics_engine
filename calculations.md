**Axis Aligned Bounding Boxes (AABB)**
An axis aligned bounding box is a box which is aligned with the two co ordinate axes such that all edges are always aligned with either x or y axis. This is used to bound complex shapes and usually is the outer bounding box.
This is best represented as two vectors, min(bottom-left) and max(top-right)
